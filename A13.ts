// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

var Cars: string[]= ['Honda' , 'Civic' , 'Mehran' , 'Audi' , 'Vigo'];

console.log("I have", Cars[4], "&" , Cars[0]);

console.log("I would like to buy", Cars[3]);

console.log("I don't like", Cars[2]);

console.log("I want to gift someone", Cars[1]);

console.log("I will sell", Cars[0]);
